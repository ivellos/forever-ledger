# Changelog

Every notable change to Forever Ledger is listed here, newest first.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- History for the coming dashboard: each character's gold over time, money in and out each day by source (auction house sales, purchases and fees, vendors, repairs, mail, trade, loot, quests, training, flights), a log of auction house sales and purchases, and 60 days of daily prices per item.
- `/fl money` shows today's money in and out for the character you're on.
- Deal alert: after a scan, a chime, an on-screen message and a chat list when something is listed far below what it alone is worth: its usual auction house price (from price history once there are 3 days of it), its vendor price, its disenchant value or an essence conversion (default: half or less, and at least 1s cheaper). Recipe profits don't count as deals; they're in the Shuffles tab. `/fl deals` lists current deals, `/fl deals 40` changes the threshold, `/fl deals sound` turns the chime on or off.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-26

Value engine, shuffle finder and vendor flips. Tested on the Forever beta. The item level 16-20 disenchant table is still the Classic one and hasn't been checked in Forever yet.

### Added
- "Worth to you" on item tooltips: the best of selling on the auction house (after the cut), selling to a vendor, or crafting it with a known recipe and selling the result. Every option is listed, best first.
- Vendor floors: the guaranteed value of a material when a known recipe turns it into something a vendor buys.
- Disenchant values for green armor and weapons up to item level 20: a "Disenchant" option in "Worth to you", a "Craft X, disenchant" option for materials, and a "Disenchants to about" tooltip line. Only shown when one of your characters has Enchanting. Crafted wands and other Enchanting products are skipped, since Forever doesn't allow disenchanting them.
- Essence conversions in "Worth to you": splitting a greater essence into 3 lesser, and combining 3 lesser into a greater, for every essence type. Disenchant values use them too.
- "Worth to you" follows chains up to 4 steps long, for example Linen Cloth → Bolt of Linen Cloth → Heavy Linen Gloves → disenchant → Greater Magic Wand → vendor. Only the three best recipes are listed.
- Inside a chain, auction house prices with fewer than 5 listings are ignored, so one overpriced listing can't inflate values.
- Shuffle finder: `/fl shuffles` lists the best shuffles in two groups, ones that end with vendor sales (safe) and ones that end on the auction house (depend on buyers). Each shows what to buy, profit per craft, return and a rough profit per hour. `/fl shuffles all` lists everything, including one-off deals with fewer than 5 listed.
- Shuffles tab in the ledger window: the same two groups as `/fl shuffles`, one row each with profit, return and profit per hour. Click a row to see what to buy and each step. Refresh recalculates. Items that disenchant the same way are grouped into one row, for example "Item level 16-20 green armor (27 items)".
- Vendor flips tab: things you can buy on the auction house and sell straight to a vendor for more, ranked by total profit on offer. They're no longer mixed in with shuffles.
- "Use recipes from" checkboxes on the Shuffles tab: choose which characters' recipes count, for shuffles and tooltip values alike.
- "Buy at or below" on tooltips for anything you can craft with, disenchant or convert: the most worth paying, after the safety margin. Green when the current price is already below it.
- `/fl margin` sets the safety margin for shuffles (default 10%), and `/fl seconds` sets the seconds per craft used for profit per hour (default 3).
- `/fl cut` shows or changes the auction house cut used in values (default 5%).
- Minimap button: click to open or close the ledger, right-click for shuffles, drag to move it. `/fl minimap` hides or shows it.

### Changed
- Two scan buttons, in the ledger window and on the auction house: "Full scan" (reads everything in seconds) shows "Ready" or a countdown to when Blizzard allows the next one (about every 15 minutes), and "Scan materials" scans what your recipes use.
- `/fl scan` does a full scan when one is allowed and scans your materials otherwise. `/fl scan materials` forces the materials scan. If the auction house doesn't send a full scan within 30 seconds, the materials scan runs instead.
- The materials scan waits 3 seconds instead of 6 for items with no reply, and tries those items once more at the end.
- The "scan finished" and "full scan done" messages say how long the scan took.

### Fixed
- Auction house scans read prices for items sold one at a time (bags, oils, rods) far too low, for example Linen Reagent Bags at 19c instead of 13s. Forever already reports these per item. Full scans weren't affected.
- The "Scanning" line in the ledger window now clears after a full scan finishes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-26

First test version for the Forever beta.

### Added
- Character profiles: level, faction, professions and skill, saved on login.
- Recipe capture: every learned recipe and its materials, saved when a profession window opens.
- Vendor prices: vendor sell prices from the game, vendor buy prices from merchant windows, with defaults for common thread, dye and Simple Wood.
- Auction house scanning of every material your characters use, plus an optional full scan.
- Prices from Auctionator, TSM and Auctioneer when your own scan is older than 12 hours.
- Tooltip lines for price, vendor cost and which characters use an item.
- Export and import between accounts, and a plain-text price list.
- `/fl api` report for testing on the beta.
